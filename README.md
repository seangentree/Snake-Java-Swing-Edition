# Snake Game: Java Edition

Welcome to my reconstruction of Snake completely coded in Java using Swing. This was developed using IntelliJ IDEA and works in such an environment. Clone the repo into IntelliJ, then head to SnakeGame.java and run the program from there. Make sure Java is installed on your computer of course as the entire project is written using it. Have fun and try to beat your high score! I did not implement an ending so the max points should be 576.

Still working on how to allow users to play the game on their desktops as well in the IDEs. The "main" method is in "SnakeGame.java", please reach out if you have a solution.
